"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess","The rules of chess are governed by the World Chess Federation, which is known by the initials FIDE, meaning Fédération Internationale des Échecs. The rules are in the section Laws of Chess of the FIDE Handbook. FIDE also give rules and guidelines for chess tournaments.\nSetup[change | change source]\nChess is played on a square board divided into eight rows of squares called ranks and eight columns called files, with a dark square in each player's lower left corner. This is altogether 64 squares. The colors of the squares are laid out in a checker (chequer) pattern in light and dark squares. To make speaking and writing about chess easy, each square has a name. Each rank has a number from 1 to 8, and each file a letter from a to h. This means that every square on the board has its own label, such as g1 or f5. The pieces are in white and black sets. The players are called White and Black, and at the start of a game each player has 16 pieces. The 16 pieces are one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns. in this game out can get up to a quadruple pon, king, knight, queen, and also the king although it is very rare.\nMovement\nDefinitions: vertical lines are files; horizontal lines are ranks; lines at 45° are diagonals. Each piece has its own way of moving around the board. The X marks the squares where the piece can move.\n* The knight is the only piece that can jump over another piece.\n* No piece may move to a square occupied by a piece of the same color.\n* All pieces capture the same way they move, except pawns.\n* The king (K for short) can move one square in any direction. The king may not move to any square where it is threatened by an opposing piece. However, the king can move to a square that is occupied by an opponent's piece and capture the piece, taking it off the board.\n* The queen (Q) can move any distance in any direction on the ranks, files and diagonals.\n* The rooks (R) move any distance on the ranks or files.\n* The bishops (B) move diagonally on the board. Since a bishop can only move diagonally, it will always be on the same color square.\n* The knights (Kt or N) move in an "L" shape. Each move must be either two squares along a rank and one square along a file, or two squares along a file and one square along a rank. It is the only piece that can jump over other pieces. Like the other pieces, it captures an opposing piece by landing on its square.\n* The pawns can only move up the board. On its first move a pawn may move either one or two squares forward. A pawn captures one square diagonally, not as it moves: see white circles on its diagram. In some situations, pawns can capture opponent's pawns in a special way called en passant, which means in passing in French (see below).\nCapturing\nMost pieces capture as they move. If a piece lands on an opponent's piece, the opposing piece is taken off the board. There are three special cases:\n1. The king cannot be taken (see check and checkmate).\n2. No piece can be taken while castling (see below).\n3. Pawns take one square diagonally (see below)."

"Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess (https://m0911.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bobby-fischer-teaches-chess.pdf)","(A Description of the Board and the Pieces) Chess is played by two players who move by turns. Play takes place on a chessboard that contains 64 squares, i.e., eight rows of eight squares. The squares are alternately colored white and black. The board should be arranged in such a way that each player has a white square in the corner at his right. [Image of chessboard]. The chess pieces are colored light and dark, and are designated as White and Black. Each side starts off with sixteen chessmen: 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 8 Pawns. [Picture od the starting arrangement]. (Moving and Capturing) A move is the transfer of a chess piece from one square to another. A capture is the removal of an opposing piece from the board; it is accomplished by actually removing the piece from its square and replacing it with the capturing piece. You cannot capture your own piece. ((Powers of the Pieces)) The King can move or capture one square in any direction. The King cannot move to squares where it may be captured by enemy pieces; nor can the King move to squares already occupied by its own pieces. The King can capture an enemy piece within its moving range by removing the enemy piece from the board and by placing itself on the square occupied by the removed piece. The Queen can move or capture as far as it wants in any direction-horizontally, vertically, or diagonally-unless it is obstructed by a piece belonging to either side. The Rook can move or capture horizontally or vertically like the Queen, but lacks the power to move diagonally. The Rook also captures by removing the enemy piece and occupying its square. The Bishop is limited to diagonal moves or captures. It cannot move horizontally or vertically. Since the Bishop can only move diagonally, it is confined to squares of the same color throughout the game. The Bishop can capture any enemy piece within its moving range. The Knight moves differently from any other piece. Its crooked move often confuses beginners, so I will describe it in three ways: The Knight moves to squares reached by going two squares vertically or horizontally, and one square to the left or right. The Knight moves to squares reached by going one square diagonally and then one square horizontally or vertically in roughly the same direction. The Knight moves to the eight nearby squares which are not in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal straight line from the square it occupies. Note that the Knight always lands on a square of a different color from the one it started on. The Knight is the only piece that can jump over other pieces, either its own or the enemy's, in the course of its move. The Knight captures in the same way that it moves: by replacing the enemy piece on the square to which it moves. The Pawn, unlike the other pieces, moves in one fashion and captures in another. Also, it can only advance, never retreat. The Pawn moves forward-never backward-one square at a time. However, when the Pawn is on its original square it has the option of advancing one or two squares on its first move. The Pawn captures diagonally forward to the left or right, as shown. The Pawn, like the other pieces, replaces the piece it captures. (Special Moves) [ommitted for now]. (The Object of Chess) The object of Chess is to attack the enemy King in such a way that it cannot escape capture. Once this is done, the King is 'checkmated' and the game is terminated. Therefore, whenever a King is under attack, it must escape that attack before the game can go on."
